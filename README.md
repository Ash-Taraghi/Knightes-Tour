# Knights-Tour
This program demonstrates the path a knight can make in chess, so that it makes a full tour and visits every location on the chessboard without
visiting the same location twice. This program was created in Java using OOP. Classes were made for the type of piece (knight, pawn, king) as well as the types of board (regular and irregular boards), as well as a location class uisng a cordinate based cartesian plane.

## How to use
Once the project has been imported, you can run any of the following:
- TourViewer.Java : Shows the knights tour on a regular 8x8 standard chess board
- TourViewer2.Java : Shows the pawns tour on a irregular chess board
- TourViewer3.Java : Shows the knights tour on another irregular chess board
- Tour Viewer4.Java : Shows the Knights + pawn combo peice (a new chess peice I made that is a knight + pawn hybrid) on a 5x8 chess board
